**Building Interactive Systems** introduces graduate students in computer science to core topics, methods, and principles related to building systems that interact with people. Students learn from lectures; reading seminal and state-of-the-art papers on interactive systems; completing in-class and take-home assignments; and engaging a semester-long team project. The course covers approaches, methods, devices, and algorithms for user sensing, decision making, and system behavior, integrating methods from machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and human-computer interaction. 

The course integrates three modules: **LEARN** + **HACK**+ **INTEGRATE**: **LEARN** provides students with an overview of each topic through lecture, readings, and multimedia material prior to and during class; **HACK** enables students to gain hands-on experience with the topic through a structured group activity, starting in class and resulting in an assignment submission; and **INTEGRATE** involves student teams to bring components together to design, build, demonstrate, and evaluate an integrated interactive system.

See the [course site](https://wisc-hci.github.io/cs839-s23/) for the latest (and first) offering of Building Interactive Systems (Spring 2023).
