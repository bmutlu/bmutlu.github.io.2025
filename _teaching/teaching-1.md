**Building User Interfaces** introduces CS undergraduates to the wonderful world of **User Experience (UX) development** and covers the (1) programming skills you will need to prototype and build user-facing applications and (2) design skills you will need to understand user needs, devise solutions, and test how well they work. Students learn both _design_ skills and _programming_ skills and, across three modules, focus on _web_, _mobile_, and _voice_ interfaces. Each module uses the programming framework that is most commonly used in the software development industry.
